  abstract = {{Knowledge of ore grades and ore reserves as well as error estimation of these values, is fundamental for mining engineers and mining geologists. Until now no appropriate scientific approach to those estimation problems has existed: geostatistics, the principles of which are summarized in this paper, constitutes a new science leading to such an approach. The author criticizes classical statistical methods still in use, and shows some of the main results given by geostatistics. Any ore deposit evaluation as well as proper decision of starting mining operations should be preceded by a geostatistical investigation which may avoid economic failures.}},

  abstract = {Urban scholars have studied street networks in various ways, but there are data availability and consistency limitations to the current urban planning/street network analysis literature. To address these challenges, this article presents OSMnx, a new tool to make the collection of data and creation and analysis of street networks simple, consistent, automatable and sound from the perspectives of graph theory, transportation, and urban design. OSMnx contributes five significant capabilities for researchers and practitioners: first, the automated downloading of political boundaries and building footprints; second, the tailored and automated downloading and constructing of street network data from OpenStreetMap; third, the algorithmic correction of network topology; fourth, the ability to save street networks to disk as shapefiles, GraphML, or SVG files; and fifth, the ability to analyze street networks, including calculating routes, projecting and visualizing networks, and calculating metric and topological measures. These measures include those common in urban design and transportation studies, as well as advanced measures of the structure and topology of the network. Finally, this article presents a simple case study using OSMnx to construct and analyze street networks in Portland, Oregon.}

In this article, we present a taxonomic review of the VRP literature published between 2009 and June 2015. Based on an adapted version of an existing comprehensive taxonomy, we classify 277 articles and analyze the trends in the VRP literature. This classification is the first to categorize the articles to this level of detail.}

It is considered to encompass all of the managerial, physical, geographical, and informational considerations as well as the theoretic disciplines impacting this ever emerging-field. Over its lifespan the VRP literature has become quite disjointed and disparate. Keeping track of its development has become difficult because its subject matter transcends several academic disciplines and professions that range from algorithm design to traffic management. Consequently, this paper defines VRP’s domain in its entirety, accomplishes an all-encompassing taxonomy for the VRP literature, and delineates all of VRP’s facets in a parsimonious and discriminating manner. Sample articles chosen for their disparity are classified to illustrate the descriptive power and parsimony of the taxonomy. Moreover, all previously published VRP taxonomies are shown to be relatively myopic; that is, they are subsumed by what is herein presented. Because the VRP literature encompasses esoteric and highly theoretical articles at one extremum and descriptions of actual applications at the other, the article sampling includes the entire range of the VRP literature.}

  abstract = {This paper proposes a new specialized centrality measure to quantify the importance and the contribution amount of each street in an urban transportation network. Contrary to the previous general centrality measures (e.g., degree, betweenness, and closeness), this measure considers three important vehicular traffic characteristics: street capacity restrictions, the dominant pattern of travel demands, and the traffic-flow equilibrium. Applying the developed centrality measure to simulated networks shows that traffic flows more efficiently in urban networks with “small-world” configurations, where a certain number of shortcut links and locally clustered streets are allowed. However, with regular grid networks, the application of the proposed measure shows little efficiency. This outcome suggests that the regular grid is not suitable as a base structure in urban planning.}

  abstract = {This paper examines the impacts of road network density on motor vehicle travel through traffic flow and network analysis of cities in China from three perspectives: multi-city comparison with traffic flow data, multi-city and multi-period comparisons with structural characteristics. When we examine the correlation between road network density and traffic flow characteristics including the travel time and speed of 35 major cities in China, no correlation exists between them which may result from different network structures, dynamic traffic demands, traffic control plans, driving behaviors, and so on. It inspires us to explore the correlation between road network density and static travel indicators. Then structural characteristic of road networks can be treated as a fixed relatively attribute and becomes the next research emphasis of this work. Comparative analysis results of three current cities (Xiamen, Washington D.C., San Jose) indicate that the average travel distance in different cities with the similar land area will not increase significantly as road network density increases. Results of an analysis of road network evolution of Changchun, China show that the increase of road network density shortens the average road segment length as well as travel distance in general. This impact on average travel distance is also related to evolution periods or modes of urban road networks. These findings provide important empirical support for planners and policymakers to understand the impacts of road network density on transport performance and design more effective urban road networks.}
